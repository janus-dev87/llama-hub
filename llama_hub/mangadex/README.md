# MangaDex Loader

This loader fetches information from the MangaDex API, by manga title.

## Usage

```python
from llama_index import download_loader

MangaDexReader = download_loader('MangaDexReader')

loader = MangaDexReader()
documents = loader.load_data(titles=['manga title 1', 'manga title 2'], lang="en")
```

## Output

### Text

Document text is the manga title. There are alternate titles for many manga, so the canonical title will be returned, even if it is not the title that the user queried with.
