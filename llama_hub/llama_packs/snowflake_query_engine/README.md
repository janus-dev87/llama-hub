# Snowflake Query Engine Pack

This LlamaPack uses `snowflake-sqlalchemy` to connect to Snowflake, then calls `NLSQLTableQueryEngine` to query data.

## Usage

You can download the pack to a the `./snowflake_pack` directory:

```python
from llama_index.llama_packs import download_llama_pack

# download and install dependencies
SnowflakeQueryEnginePack = download_llama_pack(
  "SnowflakeQueryEnginePack", "./snowflake_pack"
)
```

From here, you can use the pack, or inspect and modify the pack in `./snowflake_pack`.

`NLSQLTableQueryEngine` uses OpenAI models by default, ensure you set your OpenAI API key.

You can set up the pack by passing in the Snowflake connection details and the table(s):

```python
# create the pack
snowflake_pack = SnowflakeQueryEnginePack(
  user="<USER>",
  password="<PASSWORD>",
  account="<ORG>-<ACCOUNT>",
  database="<DATABASE>",
  schema="<SCHEMA>",
  warehouse="<WAREHOUSE>",
  role="<ROLE>",
  tables=["<TABLE1>", "<TABLE2>",...]
)
```

The `run()` function is a light wrapper around `query_engine.query()`.  See below a sample query run. You can add additional prompt in the query text.

```python
response = snowflake_pack.run("Give me the repo id with the most stars on 2023-12-01.")
```
