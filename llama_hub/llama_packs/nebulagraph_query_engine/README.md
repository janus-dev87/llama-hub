# NebulaGraph Query Engine Pack

This LlamaPack creates a NebulaGraph query engine, and executes its `query` function. This pack offers the option of creating multiple types of query engines, namely:
* Knowledge graph vector-based entity retrieval (default if no query engine type option is provided)
* Knowledge graph keyword-based entity retrieval
* Knowledge graph hybrid entity retrieval
* Raw vector index retrieval
* Custom combo query engine (vector similarity + KG entity retrieval)
* KnowledgeGraphQueryEngine
* KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever

## CLI Usage

You can download llamapacks directly using `llamaindex-cli`, which comes installed with the `llama-index` python package:

```bash
llamaindex-cli download-llamapack NebulaGraphQueryEnginePack --download-dir ./nebulagraph_pack
```

You can then inspect the files at `./nebulagraph_pack` and use them as a template for your own project!

## Code Usage

You can download the pack to a `./nebulagraph_pack` directory:

```python
from llama_index.llama_pack import download_llama_pack

# download and install dependencies
NebulaGraphQueryEnginePack = download_llama_pack(
  "NebulaGraphQueryEnginePack", "./nebulagraph_pack"
)
```

From here, you can use the pack, or inspect and modify the pack in `./nebulagraph_pack`.

Then, you can set up the pack like so:

```python
# Load the docs (example of Paleo diet from Wikipedia)
from llama_index import download_loader

WikipediaReader = download_loader("WikipediaReader")
loader = WikipediaReader()
docs = loader.load_data(pages=['Paleolithic diet'], auto_suggest=False)
print(f'Loaded {len(docs)} documents')

# get NebulaGraph credentials (assume it's stored in credentials.json)
with open('credentials.json') as f:
  nebulagraph_connection_params = json.load(f)
  username = nebulagraph_connection_params['username']
  password = nebulagraph_connection_params['password']
  ip_and_port = nebulagraph_connection_params['ip_and_port']

space_name = "paleo_diet"
edge_types, rel_prop_names = ["relationship"], ["relationship"]
tags = ["entity"]
max_triplets_per_chunk = 10

# create the pack
nebulagraph_pack = NebulaGraphQueryEnginePack(
  username = username,
  password = password,
  ip_and_port = ip_and_port,
  space_name = space_name,
  edge_types = edge_types,
  rel_prop_names = rel_prop_names,
  tags = tags,
  max_triplets_per_chunk = max_triplets_per_chunk,
  docs = docs
)
```

Optionally, you can pass in the `query_engine_type` from `NebulaGraphQueryEngineType` to construct `NebulaGraphQueryEnginePack`.  If `query_engine_type` is not defined, it defaults to Knowledge Graph vector based entity retrieval.
```python
from llama_hub.llama_packs.nebulagraph_query_engine.base import NebulaGraphQueryEngineType

# create the pack
nebulagraph_pack = NebulaGraphQueryEnginePack(
  username = username,
  password = password,
  ip_and_port = ip_and_port,
  space_name = space_name,
  edge_types = edge_types,
  rel_prop_names = rel_prop_names,
  tags = tags,
  max_triplets_per_chunk = max_triplets_per_chunk,
  docs = docs
  query_engine_type = NebulaGraphQueryEngineType.KG_HYBRID
)
```

`NebulaGraphQueryEnginePack` is a enum defined as follows:
```python
class NebulaGraphQueryEngineType(str, Enum):
    """NebulaGraph query engine type"""

    KG_KEYWORD = "keyword"
    KG_HYBRID = "hybrid"
    RAW_VECTOR = "vector"
    RAW_VECTOR_KG_COMBO = "vector_kg"
    KG_QE = "KnowledgeGraphQueryEngine"
    KG_RAG_RETRIEVER = "KnowledgeGraphRAGRetriever"
```

The `run()` function is a light wrapper around `query_engine.query()`, see a sample query below.

```python
response = nebulagraph_pack.run("Tell me about the benefits of paleo diet.")
```

You can also use modules individually.

```python
# call the query_engine.query()
query_engine = nebulagraph_pack.query_engine
response = query_engine.query("query_str")
```
