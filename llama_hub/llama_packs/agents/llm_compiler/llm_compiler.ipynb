Extreme cold temperatures, below about 15 °F or -9 °C, are rare due to the moderating influence of the adjacent Puget Sound, the greater Pacific Ocean, and Lake Washington. The city is often cloudy due to frequent storms and lows moving in from the Pacific Ocean.\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[1;3;34mRan task: vector_tool_Chicago. Observation: During wintertime, the city experiences relatively cold and snowy conditions. Blizzards can occur, as seen in winter 2011. The normal winter high from December through March is about 36 °F (2 °C). January and February are the coldest months. A polar vortex in January 2019 nearly broke the city's cold record of −27 °F (−33 °C), which was set on January 20, 1985. Measurable snowfall can continue through the first or second week of April. The city's proximity to Lake Michigan tends to keep the lakefront somewhat cooler in summer and less brutally cold in winter than inland parts of the city and suburbs away from the lake. Northeast winds from wintertime cyclones departing south of the region sometimes bring the city lake-effect snow.\n",
