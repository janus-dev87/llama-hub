## CLI Usage

You can download llamapacks directly using `llamaindex-cli`, which comes installed with the `llama-index` python package:

```bash
llamaindex-cli download-llamapack CogniswitchAgentPack --download-dir ./cs_pack
```
## Code Usage

```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
from llama_index.llama_packs import CogniswitchAgentPack
import os


### Cogniswitch Credentials and OpenAI token
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = <your openai token>
# cogniswitch_tool_args = {
#   "cs_token":<your cogniswitch platform token>, 
#   "apiKey":<your cogniswitch apikey>
# }

cogniswitch_agent_pack = CogniswitchAgentPack(cogniswitch_tool_args)
```

From here, you can use the pack, or inspect and modify the pack in `./cs_pack`.

The `run()` function is a light wrapper around `agent.chat()`.
