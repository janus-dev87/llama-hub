# Genius Loader

This loader connects to the Genius API and loads lyrics, metadata, and album art into `Documents`.

As a prerequisite, you will need to register with [Genius API](https://genius.com/api-clients) and create an app in order to get a `client_id` and a `client_secret`. You should then set a `redirect_uri` for the app. The `redirect_uri` does not need to be functional. You should then generate an access token as an instantiator for the GeniusReader.

## Usage

Here's an example usage of the GeniusReader. It will retrieve songs that match specific lyrics. Acceptable agruments are lyrics (str): The lyric snippet you're looking for and will return List[Document]: A list of documents containing songs with those lyrics.
