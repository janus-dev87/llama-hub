# Exa (formerly Metaphor) Tool 

This tool connects to [Exa](https://exa.ai/) to easily enable
your agent to search and get HTML content from the Internet.

To begin, you need to obtain an API key on the [Exa developer dashboard](https://dashboard.exa.ai).

## Usage

This tool has more a extensive example usage documented in a Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/emptycrown/llama-hub/tree/main/llama_hub/tools/notebooks/exa.ipynb)

Here's an example usage of the ExaToolSpec.

```python
from llama_hub.tools.exa import ExaToolSpec
from llama_index.agent import OpenAIAgent

exa_tool = ExaToolSpec(
    api_key='your-key',
)
agent = OpenAIAgent.from_tools(exa_tool.to_tool_list())

agent.chat('Can you summarize the news published in the last month on superconductors')
```

`search`: Search for a list of articles relating to a natural language query
`retrieve_documents`: Retrieve a list of documents returned from `exa_search`.
`search_and_retrieve_documents`: Combines search and retrieve_documents to directly return a list of documents related to a search
`find_similar`: Find similar documents to a given URL.
`current_date`: Utility for the Agent to get todays date

This loader is designed to be used as a way to load data as a Tool in a Agent. See [here](https://github.com/emptycrown/llama-hub/tree/main) for examples.
