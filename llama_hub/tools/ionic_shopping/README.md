# Ionic Shopping Tool

[Ionic](https://ioniccommerce.com) is a plug and play ecommerce marketplace for AI Assistants. 
By including the Ionic Tool in your agent, you are effortlessly providing your users with the ability 
to shop and transact directly within your agent, and youâ€™ll get a cut of the transaction.

## Attribution
Llearn more about how [Ionic attributes sales](https://docs.ioniccommerce.com/guides/attribution) 
to your agent. Provide your Ionic API Key when instantiating the tool:
```python
from llama_hub.tools.ionic_shopping.base import IonicShoppingToolSpec

ionic_tool = IonicShoppingToolSpec(api_key="<my Ionic API Key>").to_tool_list()
```


## Usage
Try it out using the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/run-llama/llama-hub/blob/main/llama_hub/tools/notebooks/ionic_shopping.ipynb).

```python
import openai
from llama_index.agent import OpenAIAgent
from llama_hub.tools.ionic_shopping.base import IonicShoppingToolSpec

openai.api_key = "sk-api-key"

ionic_tool = IonicShoppingToolSpec(api_key="<my Ionic API Key>").to_tool_list()

agent = OpenAIAgent.from_tools(ionic_tool)
print(
    agent.chat(
        "I'm looking for a 5k monitor can you find me 3 options between $600 and $1000"
    )
)
```

`query`: used to search for products and to get product recommendations


Your users can use natural language to specify how many results they would like to see 
and what their budget is.
