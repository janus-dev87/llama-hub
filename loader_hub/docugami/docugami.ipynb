Typical chunking techniques, even with overlap, will struggle with providing the LLM sufficent context to answer such questions. With upcoming very large context LLMs, it may be possible to stuff a lot of tokens, perhaps even entire documents, inside the context but this will still hit limits at some point with very long documents, or a lot of documents.\n",
