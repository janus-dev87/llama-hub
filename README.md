# GPT Index Loader Hub

This is a simple library of all the data loaders / readers that have been created by the community in GPT Index. The goal is to make it extremely easy to connect large language models to a large variety of knowledge sources. These are general-purpose utilities that can be used in [GPT Index](https://github.com/jerryjliu/gpt_index/tree/main/gpt_index) (e.g. when building a index), [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) (e.g. when building different tools an agent can use), and more.
